# Cookie Stand

*This repository contains the following files and modifications ordered by date in descending order*

+ **10-25-16:** Made it so that the sales data displayed in a table rather than a series of lists, and added totals for each hour across all stores. Tried to get the staffing table to work, but wasn't able to get it figured out.

+ **10-24-16:** Created app.js, index.html, and style.css files and commited them to the repository. These are the files governing the the appearance of the sales and index pages, as well as the script that produces the randomized cookie sales based on the parameters given for each store.
